# Hints:
* A locked vault guards the first secret—its key is known, yet unseen.
* The secrets are hidden in plain sight, but locked away with a key. First, uncover the key from the encrypted vault, then use it to reveal the hidden message within the image. A trail of hex awaits your discovery!
* Even after revealing the message, its true form remains disguised. Look beyond its current state—transform it, and another layer of the secret will unfold.
* The message is still cloaked, but a simple shift can set it straight. Rotate the letters, and what was once scrambled will start to make sense.
* The message is locked with a familiar twist—shift it back to uncover the truth. But the key to the shift? That’s for you to discover.
* The journey through ciphers and transformations nears its end. Strip away this final layer, and the true message will finally come to light.
